A "Sismos" (Earthquakes) table contains a created, lat, long, depth, richter, location country. This is the table:

CREATE TABLE sismos (
	id INTEGER NOT NULL, 
	created DATETIME, 
	lat FLOAT, 
	long FLOAT, 
	depth FLOAT, 
	richter FLOAT, 
	description VARCHAR, 
	location VARCHAR, 
	country VARCHAR, 
	content_hash VARCHAR, 
	PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

* location queries should be a "like query".
* country names such as Panama and Panama with a tilde should work as well, so for it should add an extra condition, for Panam√° OR Panama.
* queries can be in any language you understand.
* richter is a scale, so people might just call it "scale" or "escala"
* if limit not found limit the query to 5 results, always order by created desc please do not allow any sql injections.

Create a SQL query using Sqlite3 syntax using my table for user prompt:

"$prompt"
