A "locations" table with all the states from Nicaragua, it does NOT include cities, is defined as:

CREATE TABLE locations (
	id INTEGER NOT NULL, 
	created DATETIME, 
    name VARCHAR,
	lat FLOAT, 
	long FLOAT, 
	PRIMARY KEY (id)
);

Based on user prompt, create a sql query that will return the records that match the city in a like query.

* the user might user phrases like "I am in Managua" or "Estoy en boaco"
* if the user asks for a location not in Nicaragua, do not generate a SQL query but instead a string "NO_QUERY"

This is the user prompt:

"Jalapasss"
